# Guess My Number

### About the game:

To win the game you need to guess a random number (secret number) between 1 and 20. <br>
Of course, you have help. <br> <br>
* If a number that you inserted is higher than the secret number, the text will show up: "Too high!". <br> <br>
* If a number that you inserted is lower than the secret number, the text will show up: "Too low!". <br> <br>
* If you guess the correct secret number the text will show up and say: "Correct Number!". <br>
Also, the screen will be green in color. <br> <br>
* But if you do not guess a secret number a text will show up and say: "You lost the game. Try again!". <br>
Also, the screen will be in red color. <br> <br>

There is maybe more to explain, but you will figure it out within the game.
